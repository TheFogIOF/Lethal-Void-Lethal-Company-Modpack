[!READ THIS!]

## The bulk of settings are created and applied individually foreach different entry in a group. They are not generated until after enabling the main true/false toggle for the related setting then rebooting the game.
## Each initial entry is marked with either 'Host Only' or 'All Players'. 'Host Only' settings are only set by the host and do not run on clients. They do not need to be synced.
## 'All Players' settings MUST BE SYNCED and set on all players in the lobby.
## If in doubt just send the config file to everyone.
# Setting type: String
# Default value: This does nothing btw.
Important Info !!! = This does nothing btw.

[_DungeonLists_]

## Excludes the listed dungeons from the config. If they are already created, they will be removed on config regeneration.
# Setting type: String
# Default value: 
Blacklisted Dungeons (All Players (for dungeon size)) = 

## If set to true, only the dungeons listed above will be generated.
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: false
Is Dungeon Blacklist a Whitelist? (All Players (for dungeon size)) = false

[_Dungeons_]

## If set to true, this refines the dungeon loading process to retry with various imput sizes.
## Instead of a hard-cap of 20 attempts, the dungeon will go through and attempt to generate with a different size until it succeeds.
## This *should* only fail if the dungeon has its own generation issues or its size multiplier is reduced below an acceptable size to begin with.
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: true
Enable Dungeon Generation Safeguards? (All Players) = true

## The number of attempts made by the dungeon to generate using its original input size multiplier before it begins to adjust the multiplier either upwards or downwards.
## Previously, the size adjustment used to happen after just one failed attempt.
# Setting type: Int32
# Default value: 20
Retries before Changing Size (All Players) = 20

## The number of generation attempts spent on each size bracket (The brackets are: 20x-10x, 10x-5x, 5x-3x, 3x-2x, and 2x-1x for reference).
## Increasing this value gives an exponentially higher chance of generation success but takes more time.
# Setting type: Int32
# Default value: 25
Tries per Dungeon Size Bracket (All Players) = 25

## If set to true, allows altering various dungeon size related numbers. This includes the moon-tied size multipliers, the Dungeon's Map Tile Size (which is divided from the moon's size), a Dungeon specific min/max size clamp applied after the MTS is factored in, the scaler to determine how strict the size clamp should be, and a Dungeon specific min/max random size multiplier applied after the clamping.
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: false
Enable Dungeon Size Overrides? (All Players) = false

## If set to true, allows altering the dungeon selection pool tied to the dungeon by moon name, level tags, route price range, and mod name.
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: false
Enable Dungeon Selection Overrides? (Host Only) = false

## If set to true, allows adding/replacing enemies on levels based on the current dungeon (inside, day, and night).
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: false
Enable Enemy Injection by Current Dungeon? (Host Only) = false

## If set to true, allows adding scrap to levels based on matching tags.
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: false
Enable Scrap Injection by Current Dungeon? (Host Only) = false

[_Enemies_]

## Determines the order that adding enemies, multiplying enemy rarities, and replacing enemies occurs in.
## Used for global, tag, current weather, and current dungeon enemy injections.
## Acceptable values include "replace,multiply,add","Multiply,Replace,Add","MULTIPLY,ADD,REPLACE" etc. Do not put other stuff in it like "glipglorp".
# Setting type: String
# Default value: add,multiply,replace
Order of Operations (Host Only) = add,multiply,replace

## If set to true, extends the 20 inside/day/night enemy caps to the maximum (127) and sets the interior enemy spawn waves to be hourly instead of every other hour.
## A *small* third effect of this setting is that enemies will instantly emerge from their vent when spawned.
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: false
Free Them? (Host Only) = false

## When enabled, this setting adjusts the enemy spawn rate to match the new enemy powers. Note that this requires the ‘Enemy Overrides’ setting to be true.
## For example, Experimentation has a default max power of 4 for interior enemies. If you set this to 6, interior enemies will spawn ~1.5x as fast.
## This applies to interior, day, and night enemy spawns.
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: false
Scale Enemy Spawn Rate? (Host Only) = false

## If set to true, allows you to set a new value per moon that tweaks the enemy spawn timing.
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: false
Accelerate Enemy Spawning? (Host Only) = false

# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: false
Flatten Enemy Curves? (Host Only) = false

## If set to true, after enemy spawn lists are updated by various means, any time there are 2 or more of the same enemy, only the entry for the enemy with the highest rarity will be kept.
## This means that if 4 sources add the bracken at various rarities, only the highest value is kept. (In "Flowerman:5,Flowerman:75,Flowerman:66,Flowerman:73" The bracken will only be added once with a rarity of 75.)
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: false
Remove Duplicate Enemies? (Host Only) = false

## If this and Remove Duplicates is set to true, the lowest rarity of a given enemy with be kept instead of its highest rarity.
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: false
Keep Smallest Rarity? (Host Only) = false

## If this and Remove Duplicates is set to true, any enemies with that have an entry of 0 rarity will be kept regardless. This allows you to blacklist enemies from specific weathers/tags/dungeons by putting EnemyName:0 under the setting.
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: false
Always Keep Zeros? (Host Only) = false

# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: false
Big Enemy Lists? (Host Only) = false

[~Global~]

## If set to true, allows adding/replacing enemies to the indoor, daytime, and nighttime enemy pools as well as adding scrap onto every moon through only a few settings.
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: false

# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: true

# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: false

## Default Example: (1.1) ^ -(4-2) = 82.6% of the multiplier.

# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: false
Adjust Scrap Value for PlayerCount? (Host Only) = false

## Default Example: (1.1) ^ (4-2) = 21% dungeon size increase.

# Default value: POPULATION: None, save for the shadows that haunt its depths.\n\nCONDITIONS: Zenit lies hidden beneath the icy surface, its underground passages carved into the frozen bedrock. The air is heavy with the chill of the depths, and the silence is punctuated only by the distant echoes of the frozen world above.\n\nSTRUCTURE: Zenit Subterrane is a labyrinthine network of tunnels and chambers, its reinforced walls providing shelter from the relentless cold outside. The dim glow of emergency lighting casts eerie shadows across the stark metal corridors.\n\nFAUNA: Within the labyrinthine tunnels, whispers of dangerous entities echo, their presence suggested by eerie disturbances and unsettling encounters reported by past explorers.\n\nHISTORY: Zenit was constructed as a refuge from the inhospitable conditions of the moon\'s surface, a sanctuary for those seeking shelter from the icy wilderness above. Yet, as communication with the surface was lost, the bunker became a tomb, its halls haunted by the ghosts of those who once sought solace within its walls.
